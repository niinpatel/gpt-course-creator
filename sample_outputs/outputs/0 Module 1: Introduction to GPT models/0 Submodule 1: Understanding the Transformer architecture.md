## Submodule 1: Understanding the Transformer architecture

In this submodule, we will dive into the fundamentals of the Transformer architecture, which serves as the backbone of GPT models. By gaining a solid understanding of the different components of the Transformer, such as the self-attention mechanism and the feed-forward neural network, we will be well-equipped to build our GPT model from scratch.

### What is the Transformer architecture?

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., is a revolutionary model that has significantly impacted the field of natural language processing (NLP). It has outperformed traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, by leveraging the power of self-attention mechanisms.

The key idea behind the Transformer is that it processes entire sequences of words simultaneously, instead of sequentially like traditional models. This parallel processing capability makes it highly scalable and enables us to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism is the core building block of the Transformer architecture. It allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence relative to others. By assigning attention weights, the model can focus on relevant parts of the input sequence while generating context-aware representations.

The self-attention mechanism operates through three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). These matrices are derived from the input embeddings and transformed linearly to capture relationships between different words. The attention weights are computed by taking the dot product between the Query and Key matrices, followed by a softmax operation to obtain a probability distribution. The values are then weighted by the attention weights and summed to produce the output representations.

### Feed-Forward Neural Network

In addition to self-attention mechanisms, the Transformer architecture also incorporates feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) to introduce non-linearity and enhance its expressive power. Each Transformer layer consists of a two-layer FFNN, with a ReLU activation function applied to the intermediate layer. The FFNN allows the model to capture complex patterns and learn higher-level representations from the input sequence.

### Putting it all together

To build a Transformer-based GPT model, we need to understand how to stack multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. We also need to define the input and output formats, handle positional encoding, and optimize the model for better performance. In the next submodule, we will explore the preprocessing and tokenization steps required for training a GPT model. We will learn about different techniques for handling text data effectively and prepare our data for building a functional GPT model.

To summarize, in this submodule, we covered the basics of the Transformer architecture, including the self-attention mechanism and the feed-forward neural network. We also discussed the advantages of the Transformer architecture over traditional RNN models. In the next submodule, we will dive deeper into the preprocessing and tokenization steps for training a GPT model.
