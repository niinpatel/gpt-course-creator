# Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that encompasses machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and information engineering. It centers on making machines understand and communicate in human language, a task that is far from simple due to the complexity and variability of human language.

NLP has become a fundamental tool for many applications in today's digital world, such as: 
- Translating text from one language to another
- Sentiment analysis, determining whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral
- Conversational AI, like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant
- Information extraction, for instance picking out key entities or themes in a body of text
- And many others.

Before delving into the specifics of NLP and how it's used, let’s first understand some fundamental principles and terminologies.

**Corpus**: This is the term used to describe a large set of texts. For example, all of the tweets ever sent constitutes a corpus, as do all English language books.

**Tokenization**: This is the task of breaking up text into words or other meaningful components. For example, the sentence "Bob threw the ball" would be tokenized into "Bob", "threw", "the", "ball".

**Part of Speech Tagging (POS tagging)**: This is the task of labeling the words in your text by their part of speech. For example, "Jane is an amazing guitarist" would involve tagging "Jane" as a proper noun, "is" as a verb, "an" as an article, "amazing" as an adjective, and "guitarist" as a noun.

NLP integrates theories from multiple fields (like computer science and linguistics) to determine how best to interact with systems using natural language. Machine learning and deep learning have recently become pivotal in enhancing NLP’s reach and applicability. This allows for the design of models that can understand language, from sentiment, to category, to important named entities.

In the next module, we will delve into some preprocessing techniques that are often used alongside NLP to help streamline the text data and make it more digestible for AI models, including tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatization. Stay tuned!
