# Text Preprocessing Techniques

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the ability of a computer to understand and interpret human language. As you can guess, human language is complex and often messy. We don't always use the perfect grammar, we use slang, and often, we write things the way we speak them. This variability makes it hard for machines to understand language.

To make sense of language and provide some form of regularity, NLP employs a few methods to preprocess text data. This preprocessing helps transform text into a more digestible form so that machine learning algorithms can perform better. 

## Tokenization 

The first step to text preprocessing is tokenization. Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or terms. Each word, or token, becomes an input for a machine learning algorithm. The tokenized words are considered 'separate' and 'distinct' by the algorithm. 

Let's look at the following Python example that uses NLTK, a common NLP library:

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "This is a sentence. It uses normal words."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)

# Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'sentence', '.', 'It', 'uses', 'normal', 'words', '.']
```

## Stemming

Stemming is a method in NLP for reducing a word to its word stem by removing the suffix from a word and reduce it to its root word. For example, "jumping" might be reduced to "jump".

This can sometimes be beneficial for understanding the general context of a sentence without getting bogged down in particulars.

Here's an example using the NLTK library:

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

stemmer= PorterStemmer()

text="There is a bunch of cats chasing mice"
tokenized_text=word_tokenize(text)
for word in tokenized_text:
    print(stemmer.stem(word))
    
# Output: 'There', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'cat', 'chase', 'mice'
```
    
## Lemmatization

Lemmatization, similar to stemming, is a process of reducing a word to its base form. It, however, takes the context and part of speech into consideration before performing the operation. The transformed words (lemmas) are actual dictionary words which allows the model to interpret these words better in comparison to the words transformed through stemming.

Here's an example using NLTK:

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

lemmatizer=WordNetLemmatizer()

text="There are several cats chasing mice"
tokenized_text=word_tokenize(text)
for word in tokenized_text:
    print(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word))
    
# Output: 'There', 'are', 'several', 'cat', 'chasing', 'mouse'
```

As you may have noticed, both the stemmer and the lemmatizer reduced "cats" to "cat". However, unlike the stemmer, the lemmatizer was unable to appropriately transform "chasing" to "chase". This is one of the many considerations to take into account when deciding whether to use stemming or lemmatization. 

Text preprocessing, encompassing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, is essential in simplifying and standardizing text data for model readiness. Preprocessing effectively helps machines to better understand and interpret human language, paving the way for a more accurate and deeper analysis.
