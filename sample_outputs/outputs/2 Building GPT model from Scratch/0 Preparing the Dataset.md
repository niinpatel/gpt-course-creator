# Preparing the Dataset

Before any model can be trained, the first step is always to prepare the dataset. The success of a GPT model relies heavily on the quality of data it is trained on. For building our model, the dataset preparation process will involve steps like data cleaning, pre-processing, and splitting the data into training and dev sets. 

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is one of the most critical parts of data preparation. This stage involves removing unnecessary noise from the dataset. In the context of natural language processing, noise can come in many forms, such as punctuation, special characters, and even stop words like 'is', 'an', 'the', which don't contain relevant information. All these can affect the quality of predictions our model would produce. Users can apply various techniques to clean text data, such as removing HTML tags if the data is scraped from web pages, handling emoticons in case of social media data, handling contractions, etc.

```python
import re
def cleanse_text(text):
    text = re.sub('<.*?>', '', text) # remove HTML tags
    text = ''.join(c for c in text if not c.isdigit()) # remove numbers
    text = ''.join([c for c in text if c not in ('!', ".", ":", ";", ',', "'")]) # remove punctuations
    return text
```

## Data Pre-Processing

Once we have a clean dataset, it's time to transform it into a format that our GPT model can understand. This usually involves tokenizing the data, where we break down the text into smaller pieces called tokens.

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Tokenize the text
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize('Hello, GPT model!')
```

## Data Splitting

The last step in data preparation is splitting our dataset into two parts â€” a training set and a dev set (also known as the validation set). The training set is what we use to train our model, while the dev set is used to evaluate the model's performance and tune its parameters. The ratio in which you split your dataset will depend on your needs and the size of your dataset.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assume that 'data' is your pre-processed text
train_data, dev_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)
```

Preparing your dataset is one of the most crucial steps in the ML pipeline. A well-prepared dataset can be the difference between a model that provides insightful predictions and one that just produces noise.
