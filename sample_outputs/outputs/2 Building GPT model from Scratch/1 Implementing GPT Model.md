# Implementing GPT Model

Congratulations! You've reached an important milestone in this course – implementing the GPT model from scratch. After having understood the theories, concepts, and preparations behind GPT, now, we start 'doing'. We'll use Python as our primary coding language along with imperative library frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## The GPT Model Architecture
The Generalized Pre-training Transformer (GPT) model typically has 12 layers, each composed of a self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward neural network.

An essential aspect of understanding the GPT model is the concept of attention. In simple terms, attention allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input while giving less importance to the others. Self-attention, as implemented in GPT, applies this concept to its own layer outputs. This mechanism helps the model to understand the contextual relevance of a word in a sentence.

## Implementing GPT: A Step by Step guide

### Initialization
Before building the model layers, let's initialize our parameters. For simplicity, we'll use a scaled-down version of the actual model: 6 layers, hidden size 256, and 8 attention heads.

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# INITIALIZATION
LAYERS = 6
HEADS = 8
HIDDEN_SIZE = 256
VOCAB_SIZE = tokenizer.vocab_size
```

### Building GPT Layers
Every GPT layer consists of a self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward neural network. Let’s define these layers.

```python
# Self-Attention Layer
self_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(HIDDEN_SIZE, HEADS)

# Feed-Forward Network
feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(HIDDEN_SIZE, 4 * HIDDEN_SIZE),
    nn.GELU(),
    nn.Linear(4 * HIDDEN_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE)
)
```

### Layer Normalization
Each GPT layer includes two sub-layers, and each sub-layer is followed by a layer normalization.

```python
# Layer Normalization
norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(HIDDEN_SIZE)
norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(HIDDEN_SIZE)
```

### Positional Encoding
The GPT model relies on position encodings to understand the sequence of the input tokens. These positional encodings must be added to the token embeddings before being passed to the GPT layers.

```python
# Positional Encoding
position_enc = nn.Embedding(MAX_LENGTH, HIDDEN_SIZE)
```

### Dropout
Let's also add dropout to our model. Dropout is a simple way to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some features to zero during training.

```python
# Dropout
dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
```

### The Final Step: Building a GPT Model
Now that we've defined our building blocks, let's put them together.

```python
# GPT Model
class GPT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GPT, self).__init__()

        # embedding layer
        self.token_emb = nn.Embedding(VOCAB_SIZE, HIDDEN_SIZE)

        # position encodings
        self.position_emb = nn.Embedding(MAX_LENGTH, HIDDEN_SIZE)

        # the transformer layers
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(HIDDEN_SIZE, HEADS) for _ in range(LAYERS)])

        # dropout
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)

        # output layer
        self.lm_head = GPT2LMHeadModel(HIDDEN_SIZE, VOCAB_SIZE)

    # define the forward pass
    def forward(self, x):
        # get token and position embeddings
        token_emb = self.token_emb(x)
        position_emb = self.position_emb(torch.arange(x.size(1)).to(device))

        # add token and position embeddings
        x = token_emb + position_emb

        # apply dropout
        x = self.dropout(x)

        # pass through each transformer layer
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)

        # output layer
        return self.lm_head(x)
```

And voila! We've just implemented a GPT model from scratch. This barebone model should give you a clear overview about what happens under the hood when we talk about the GPT model. You can further enhance your understanding and expertise by expanding this model to accommodate more features and fine-tuning it for better performance.
